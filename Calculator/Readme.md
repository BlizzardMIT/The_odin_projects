# Key Takeaways:

- 1. Create functions for basic math operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and test them in the browser's console.

- 2. Implement a calculator operation structure with variables for the first number, operator, and second number.

- 3. Create an "operate" function that takes an operator and two numbers and calls the corresponding math function.

- 4. Build a basic HTML calculator with digit buttons, math operation buttons, and an "Equals" key.

- 5. Implement the display functionality to show numbers and results on the calculator.

- 6. Store and handle user inputs for multiple operations and ensure correct evaluation.

- 7. Handle edge cases and bugs, such as division by zero, preventing overflow, and handling decimal inputs.

- 8. Enable support for floating-point numbers with a decimal button and limit the input to one decimal point.

- 9. Customize the calculator's appearance using CSS, making operations distinct from keypad buttons.

- 10. Add a "backspace" button for users to undo incorrect inputs.

- 11. Implement keyboard support, handling potential issues with specific keys using event.preventDefault().
