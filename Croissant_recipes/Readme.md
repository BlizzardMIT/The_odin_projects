# Key Takeaways:

### 1. Initial Structure 
- Create an index.html file with boilerplate HTML and add an h1 heading "Odin Recipes" to the body.

### 2. Recipe Page 
- Create a "recipes" directory within "odin-recipes" and add a new HTML file with the recipe's name (e.g., lasagna.html). 
- Link this recipe page in the index.html file using an anchor tag.

### 3. Recipe Page Content 
- Design the recipe page with the following content: an image of the finished dish, a "Description" heading with recipe details, an "Ingredients" heading with an unordered list of ingredients, and a "Steps" heading with an ordered list of cooking steps.

### 4. Add More Recipes 
- Create two additional recipe pages with the same page structure as the initial recipe page. 
- Link these new recipes in the index.html file, and consider organizing the links using an unordered list to improve readability.
