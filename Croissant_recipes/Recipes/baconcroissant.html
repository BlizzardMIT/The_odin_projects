        Using store bought croissants and cooking the bacon in the oven is the key.
        Double or triple the ingredients if you going to make more than one serving.
        Salt and black pepper technically you will only need a generous pinch of both.

    <h3>Ingredients (Serving size: 1)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of hardwood bacon</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt and ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chives</li>
        <li>2 oz mild cheddar cheese, or any on hand</li>
        <li>2 small croissants or one larger</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place bacon in the air fryer and crip it up for 10 to 12 minutes at 175°C. You may also use bacon pre-set temperature on your air fryer. For oven baking: place bacon in the baking pan and bake for about 15 minutes at 180°C or until it is crispy to your desire. </li>
        <li>Make eggs. Crack two eggs in the cup and add salt, pepper and chives which are optional. Mix until the eggs are smooth. Preheat the frying pan with a dab of butter and at the lower temperature cook eggs. You could make something like an omelette and fold with cheese before adding to your sandwich or you may make scrambled eggs and toss some cheese on top to melt. </li>
        <li>Open your Croissant just by slicing in half.</li>
        <li>Add cheese eggs then slices of bacon on top.</li>
        <li>Heat it all together in the air fryer for 3-4 minutes at 175°C, microwave for 20-30 seconds or oven for 5-7 minutes at 190°C.</li>
    </ol>
