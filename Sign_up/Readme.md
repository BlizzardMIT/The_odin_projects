# Key Takeaways:

- Set up and planning: 
- - Begin by setting up a git repository and creating HTML and CSS files with simple content. Download the design file to get an idea of the layout for the HTML document.

- Gather assets: 
- - Find and download a suitable background image for the design, ensuring to credit the creator. Choose an external font for the 'logo' section and replace the image-sidebar if needed.

- Project Approach: 
- - Start by scaffolding out the page structure and then work on individual sections. Use a dark, semi-transparent background color behind the "ODIN" logo for better text readability. Match the color of the 'Create Account' button to tones in the background image (#596D48).

- Input Styling: 
- - Customize input elements with light borders (#E5E7EB) by default. Add variations for password inputs with an error class and selected inputs with a blue border and subtle box-shadow using the :focus pseudo-class.

- Responsive Design: 
- - The focus is on desktop resolution, and mobile responsiveness is not a priority. However, it's essential to ensure the project doesn't break on different desktop resolutions.

- Password Validation: 
- - Password field matching requires JavaScript implementation. If confident, implement it; otherwise, validate each field separately.
